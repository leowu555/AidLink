# AidLink — Crisis Response Coordination Platform

A hackathon MVP for coordinating relief during emergencies. AidLink helps local organizers triage reports, verify incidents, and assign volunteers—focused on a **Gaza-area crisis map** with optional JSON-backed incident data and a SQLite database for organizer workflows.

## Features

- **Landing page** — Hero, mission, CTAs (Crisis Map + Organizer Map), safety disclaimer
- **Public crisis map** — Leaflet map with **Gaza view** / **World map**, Gaza strip outline, zone summaries, and an open-incidents panel. Incidents load from `data/incidents.json` when present, otherwise from the API (Prisma), and are **scoped to the Gaza fly bounds** for display.
- **Incident drawer (public)** — Rich incident summary from JSON (criticality, casualty/manpower estimates, media, source posts) and a **phone contact** for offering help (no in-app volunteer signup on this path).
- **Incident report page** — `/map/incident/[id]` shows database-backed detail: verification, severity, **time-urgency** tier, injuries estimate, situation summary, and inbound **report** feed when seeded.
- **Organizer map** (`/dashboard`) — Map-first organizer workspace (not a separate metrics “command center”):
  - Demo **Log in as Organizer** (client-side Zustand persist; no real auth server)
  - Same map UX as the public view plus **organizer incident drawer**: verify, edit fields, **resolve** (remove from open map), assign volunteers, move assignments through statuses, **check-in code** modal
  - Bottom **open incidents** strip with counts and quick actions
  - Periodic refresh (≈15s) when logged in
  - If the DB has no open incidents, **JSON incidents** can still appear as a read-only fallback on the map

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui-style components
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Prisma + SQLite
- Leaflet (react-leaflet)
- Zustand

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure database (SQLite, file:./dev.db)
# Ensure .env contains: DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Generate Prisma client and create database
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push

# Seed demo data (Gaza-area incidents, duplicate/false examples, 24+ volunteers, sample reports)
npm run db:seed

# Optional: enrich / replace map incidents via JSON pipeline
# Place or update data/incidents.json (see /api/incidents-json)

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Demo Flow

1. **Landing** → **View Crisis Map** (public) or **Organizer Map** (`/dashboard`).
2. **Public map** → Use **Gaza view** (or zoom from world map) → Pick a marker or an incident from the panel → Read the side drawer; **contact** via the listed phone if you want to represent outreach.
3. **Incident report page** — Use a **database** incident ID (from the organizer drawer, `/api/incidents`, or after seeding) and open `/map/incident/<id>` → Review **time urgency**, injuries estimate, situation summary, and **inbound reports** when seeded.
4. **Organizer** → **Log in as Organizer (Demo)** → Select an incident → **Verify** status, **edit** details, **assign** volunteers from the **seed roster**, advance **assignment** statuses, open **check-in** with the incident code, or **resolve** the incident.

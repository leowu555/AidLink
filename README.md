AidLink is a real-time crisis coordination platform that monitors X (Twitter) for structural collapse reports in active conflict zones, verifies them using a multi-agent AI pipeline, and surfaces actionable incident data to local response coordinators. Built at ProduHacks 2026.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **🔍 Scraper** — Playwright scrapes X every hour using Gemini-generated search queries in Arabic, Ukrainian, Farsi, and English. Gemini filters noise, clusters tweets into discrete incidents, and extracts location, casualty estimates, and criticality.

2. **📤 Upload** — Fresh incidents are upserted to Supabase (PostgreSQL), preserving full timestamped history.

3. **🤖 Fetch.ai Agent Pipeline** — Three uAgents registered on Agentverse run automatically after each scrape:
   - **Analyst Agent** — fetches post content and scores each incident for reliability using ASI:One
   - **Critic Agent** — independently challenges the analyst's verdict; produces a `confirmed`, `disputed`, or `unreliable` final verdict
   - **Coordinator Agent** — synthesises all verdicts into a per-region resource allocation brief

4. **🗺️ Frontend** — Coordinators see a live map of verified incidents with criticality tiers, casualty estimates, manpower needs, and AI-generated deployment recommendations.

## ✨ Features

- **🗺️ Live crisis map** — Leaflet map with Gaza and Ukraine views, incident markers color-coded by criticality, and an open incidents panel
- **📋 Incident drawer** — Full incident detail: reliability verdict, analyst/critic scores, casualty and manpower estimates, source posts, and media
- **🧑‍💼 Organizer dashboard** — Verify incidents, assign volunteers, advance assignment statuses, check-in modal, and resolve incidents
- **🔎 AI reliability scoring** — Every incident gets an independent analyst + critic score; disputed or unreliable incidents are flagged, not hidden
- **📊 Regional allocation briefs** — Coordinator agent produces a per-region summary: overall state, priority incident ordering, concrete resource recommendations, and external support needs
- **⏰ Hourly automation** — Scheduler runs scrape → upload → analysis pipeline automatically

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- React Hook Form + Zod
- Leaflet / react-leaflet
- Zustand
- Prisma + SQLite

**Backend**
- Python
- Playwright (X scraping)
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (query generation, tweet clustering, incident extraction)
- Fetch.ai uAgents + Agentverse (multi-agent reliability pipeline)
- ASI:One / asi1-mini (analyst and critic LLM)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL — incidents, analyses, region reports)

## 🚀 Setup

### Frontend

```bash
npm install

# Configure database
# Ensure .env contains: DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run db:seed   # seeds Gaza-area incidents, volunteers, sample reports

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Backend

```bash
pip install playwright uagents uagents-core openai supabase google-genai python-dotenv httpx
playwright install chromium
```

### 🍪 X (Twitter) Authentication

The scraper uses your X session cookies to access search results. Run the cookie saver once before your first scrape:
```bash
python save_cookies.py
```

This opens a Chromium browser window. Log into X manually, then close the browser. Your session is saved to `x_cookies.json` and reused automatically by the scraper.

If you have a second X account added to the same browser session, the scraper will automatically attempt to switch to it if a page fails to load — reducing the chance of rate limiting mid-scrape.

> ⚠️ Cookies expire periodically — if the scraper logs show `❌ Cookies expired`, log out of X and re-run `save_cookies.py`.

Create a `.env` file:

```
# Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=...

# ASI:One — https://asi1.ai/dashboard/api-keys
ASI_ONE_API_KEY=...

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ...

# Agent seeds (set once, never change)
ANALYST_SEED=...
CRITIC_SEED=...
COORDINATOR_SEED=...

# Agent addresses (fill after first run)
ANALYST_ADDRESS=agent1q...
CRITIC_ADDRESS=agent1q...
COORDINATOR_ADDRESS=agent1q...

# Scheduler interval (default 60)
INTERVAL_MINUTES=60
```

Run the Supabase schema files in order via the SQL editor:
1. `supabase_schema.sql`
2. `supabase_agents_schema.sql`

### ▶️ Running the Pipeline

Start the two persistent agents:

```bash
# Terminal 1
python critic.py

# Terminal 2
python coordinator.py
```

Start the scheduler (manages the analyst automatically):

```bash
# Terminal 3
python scheduler.py
```

The scheduler runs `main.py` (scrape) → `upload_to_supabase.py` (sync) → restarts `analyst.py` (analysis pipeline) every hour.

### 🔌 First-Time Agent Setup

On first run, each agent prints its address:
```
INFO: Analyst agent address: agent1q...
```

Copy each address into `.env`, then click the inspector link printed in each terminal → Connect → Mailbox to register on Agentverse. Restart all agents once addresses are set.

## 🎬 Demo Flow

1. **Landing** → **View Crisis Map** or **Organizer Dashboard**
2. **Public map** → Switch between Gaza and Ukraine views → Click a marker → Read reliability verdict, casualty estimates, source posts
3. **Organizer** → Log in as Organizer (demo) → Select incident → Verify, edit, assign volunteers, check in, or resolve
4. **Incident detail** → `/map/incident/[id]` → Time urgency tier, situation summary, inbound reports
